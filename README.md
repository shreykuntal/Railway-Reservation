# Railway Reservation
## Project Description
This project is a Python-based train ticket reservation system that allows users to sign up, sign in, search for tickets, book tickets, and cancel tickets. It uses the "mysql.connector" module to integrate python with MySQL and manage user data and their credentials.
## Installation
The project uses the python module mysql.connector which can be installed by command 
```pip install mysql-connector-python```
## First Time Setup
1. Create a database ```users``` which will hold all the credentials and information to every user by the command ```create database users;```.
2. Run the file ```firstSetup.py``` to create table and fields for storing information and details for users and trains.
## Usage
To use the train ticket reservation system, follow the steps below:

Make sure you have completed the installation steps mentioned in the "Installation" section and also the steps in "First Time Setup" section.

Run the ```Railway Reservation.py``` file.
After running the file, a signup and signin window will appear. If you are a new user, click on the "Signup" button to create a new account. Otherwise, use the "Signin" button to log in with your existing credentials.

Once you are logged in, you can explore the different options provided by the train ticket reservation system. This includes searching for available tickets, booking a ticket, canceling a ticket, and more.

Throughout the program, the sample outputs of different options and choices are already saved in the "output" folder.
## Conclusion
I completed this project for submission to my school as part of the Computer Science (083) subject. I gained knowledge in integrating Python and MySQL, learned about python modules, and gained practical experience in working with Python and MySQL. This project allowed me to understand how to integrate Python and MySQL and execute various MySQL commands effectively.
